        <h1> Caring for Your Pet</h1>
        <h3> Caring for your Dog</h3>
            <p> Dogs are known as one of the most loyal pets and man’s best friend. 
                They do require a significant amount of care and love to thrive. It 
                is recommended to feed them more frequently as a puppy because they require 
                more nutrients while they’re growing. It is also recommended that you provide 
                them with some sort of exercise daily. That could be in physical exercise such as
                playing in the park, or through training which exercises their mind. By putting 
                your dog’s energy into something positive it deters them from doing something less 
                desirable. Be sure to keep your pup happy by keeping them tick and flea free with 
                various grooming and medication.  Of course, be sure to walk them daily and enjoy
                your new best friend.
            </p>
        <h3> Caring for your Cat</h3>
            <p> Cats are regal beings known for their grace, elegance, and interesting temperament.
                Cats are also known for their ability to take care of themselves, but you still have 
                an important part in their life as their owner. Pets require a litterbox to be cleaned
                daily and completely changed weekly to make sure that they are comfortable using it.
                Additionally, they require the essential amino acid taurine for their heart and eye 
                health, so be sure to make good food choices for your new kitten. Although cats are
                known as relatively clean animals, you should brush them frequently to reduce
                shedding and the potential for hairballs. Lastly, to protect your home and
                furniture it is ideal to 
                provide a space for your cat to scratch without damaging your house. </p>
        <h3>Caring for your Fish</h3>
            <p> Fish are known as a starter pet but require more than one would expect. Fish
                are partial to water PH and temperature, so it is imperative that you get 
                water conditioner and a thermostat when preparing for your new fish. 
                Additionally, be sure that the tank size is appropriate for the number 
                of fish that you have. A general rule for tank size is 1 gallon for every
                inch of fish (when full grown). So, if you have a 4-inch fish you should
                have at a least 4-gallon tank. When getting your fish, you should leave
                them inside of their container and sit it inside the tank so that the
                water temperature can slowly adjust. This avoids shocking the fish from the 
                sudden change in water temperature. Take care of your fish and maybe teach 
                them a trick or two. Some can even learn to jump through hoops!</p>
        <h3>Caring for your Rabbit</h3>
            <p> Rabbits are generally very shy pets but if you treat them right, they can
                become your close fluffy companion. The first thing you should do is give
                them a safe and warm space to call home. Some rabbits can be raised as
                free roam in the home or inside a pen either way, their home is the most
                important. Second most important is to bunny proof your home. This
                prevents your rabbit from chewing anything that could hurt them such 
                as wires or getting lost in vents. You also need to provide a constant
                supply of fresh hay as that is most of their diet. Additionally, it is
                good practice to set up a litterbox in the same place that they eat as
                they like to eat and use the bathroom at the same time. This encourages 
                good litterbox habits. Lastly, just pay attention to your pet. Rabbits are
                naturally prey animals so they try to hide illnesses they may have, so keep 
                and eye to make sure they are staying healthy. Play with your rabbits and have fun!</p>
